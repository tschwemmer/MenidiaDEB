%% BYOM function pathdefine.m (setting the path to the engine)
%
%  Syntax: pathdefine(varargin)
%
% A tiny piece of 'intelligent' code to add the required directories to the
% Matlab Path. Should work on UNIX, Mac and Windows, as long as the byom
% script from which this function is called is in a subdirectory of the
% BYOM directory. The addition to the path is temporary, and forgotten when
% Matlab is restarted.
% 
% In this version, the possibility is added to have TWO engine folders.
% This was done to allow use of the parallel computing toolbox of Matlab.
% By calling this function with a switch (in varargin), we can select the
% correct engine (and remove the other from the path). This requires that
% the additional engine is present in BYOM/engine_par.
% 
% Additionally, this version will remove any paths that contain
% openGUTS/engine. So no need to clean the path when switching from
% openGUTS to BYOM in the same Matlab session (openGUTS will be updated as
% well in the future to remove BYOM/engine path elements).
