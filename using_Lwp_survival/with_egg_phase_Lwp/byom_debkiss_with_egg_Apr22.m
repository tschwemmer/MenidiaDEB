% BYOM is a General framework for simulating model systems in terms of
% ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model itself needs to be
% specified in <derivatives.html derivatives.m>, and <call_deri.html
% call_deri.m> may need to be modified to the particular problem as well.
% The files in the engine directory are needed for fitting and plotting.
% Results are shown on screen but also saved to a log file (results.out).
%
% *The model:* standard DEBkiss model (see
% <http://www.debtox.info/book_debkiss.html>) following Jager et al (2013),
% <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.03.011>. Parameters on length
% basis, and including the embryonic stage.
%
% *This script:* Example is for the pond snail at maximum food. This is a
% simulation, including the embryo phase.

%% The data set
% Data are entered in matrix form, time in rows, scenarios (exposure
% concentrations) in columns. First column are the exposure times, first
% row are the concentrations or scenario numbers. The number in the top
% left of the matrix indicates how to calculate the likelihood:
%
% * -1 for multinomial likelihood (for survival data)
% * 0  for log-transform the data, then normal likelihood
% * 0.5 for square-root transform the data, then normal likelihood
% * 1  for no transformation of the data, then normal likelihood

%% Calculations and plotting
% Here, the function is called that will do the calculation and the plotting.
% Options for the plotting can be set using opt_plot (see prelim_checks.m).
% Options for the optimsation routine can be set using opt_optim. Options
% for the ODE solver are part of the global glo. 
% 
% NOTE: for this package, the options useode and eventson in glo will not
% be functional: the ODE solver is always used, and the events function as
% well.

% a difference!

% optimise and plot (fitted parameters in par_out)
par_out = calc_optim(par,opt_optim); % start the optimisation
calc_and_plot(par_out,opt_plot); % calculate model lines and plot them

% % Code below demonstrates the use of the new plotting routine. However,
% % since we have only a single treatment here, the added benefit is not so
% % great.

% % Leave the options opt_conf empty to suppress all CIs for these plots.
% % Plotting CIs requires a sample as saved by the various methods available
% % in BYOM (see examples directory).
