# MenidiaDEB
This folder contains the Matlab scripts used with the BYOM platform and DEBkiss package to model the energy budget for Menidia menidia and model hypoxia effects on early life stages. 

The scripts are modified from Tjalling Jager's code for DEBkiss, downloaded from: https://www.debtox.info/byom.html

Manuscript that accompanies the model:
Schwemmer, T. G., Nisbet, R. M., and Nye, J. A. Attributing hypoxia responses of early life Menidia menidia to energetic mechanisms with Dynamic Energy Budget theory. Submitted to Ecological Modelling, Special issue: Metabolic organization across scales of space and time.
